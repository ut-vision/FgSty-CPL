# [Optional] Foreground-only stylization
We also provide the stylization for the foreground only. Since simulating reflectance on hands is challenging and the synthetic texture bias of hands is problematic, our stylization is useful in reducing the texture bias.

Run `test.py` with the option`--fg_only`.
